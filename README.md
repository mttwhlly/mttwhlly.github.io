## Running

Run `npx http-server public -c-1` to serve the `public/` folder as a static website.

(Alternatively, use the VS Code Live Preview extension to show `public/index.html`)

## Building

Just kidding ðŸ˜‚ This is a static website, so there is no build process. Just edit the files in the `public/` folder.
